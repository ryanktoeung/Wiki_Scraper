* This application allows for the user to input key phrases to search for the Wikipedia page associated with that phrase. Then, the text from the Wikipedia page will be presented back to the user. If the user likes, they can save this data locally and access it later in the future. On a separate page, the program will present the user back with the options of whichever files that are saved. Once the user chooses the specific file, they will be presented with the data of that text file.
